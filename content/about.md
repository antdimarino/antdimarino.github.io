Hi, I'm Antonio, I'm 24 and I study computer science at Parthenope University. I live in Naples, Italy and will continue my master's studies in machine learning.

I am an admirer of *open source* and respect for *privacy*.

My other passions are: books, movies, tv series and chess.

*Keep in touch!*
